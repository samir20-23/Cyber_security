1. **Open Windows Settings**:  
   Press `Win + I` to open the **Settings** menu.

Once disabled, you should be able to run `.bat` files without the warning. Remember to **enable SmartScreen** again after running the trusted file for added security.

### **How to Digitally Sign Your `.bat` File (Advanced Method)**

If you want to permanently avoid the SmartScreen warning for trusted files, you can **digitally sign** your `.bat` files.

1. **Get a Code-Signing Certificate**:  
   Purchase a certificate from a trusted provider like Symantec, DigiCert, or Comodo.

2. **Sign the `.bat` file**:  
   You can use **SignTool** to add a valid digital signature to your file. Run the following command:

   ```bash
   signtool sign /a "C:\path\to\your\file.bat"
   ```

   This will sign your `.bat` file, making it trusted and preventing SmartScreen warnings in the future.

### **How to Run `.bat` Files as Administrator**

If you'd like to run a `.bat` file as an administrator (with higher privileges), follow these steps:

1. **Right-click the `.bat` file**.
2. Select **Run as administrator**.

   This method won’t necessarily disable SmartScreen but may allow your file to execute without any restrictions.

---

### **Important Notes**
- **Only disable SmartScreen for trusted files**. Disabling it can expose your computer to security risks.
- **Digitally signing** your files adds an extra layer of security and trust, which is recommended for permanent use.
- **SmartScreen** helps protect your PC from untrusted apps and potential malware, so it’s important to only bypass it for files you trust.

---

### **Conclusion**
Following the steps above, you should be able to run your `.bat` files without receiving the SmartScreen warning. Be sure to always verify the source of your files and exercise caution when running scripts.

**How to add gifs or animations:**

To add gifs or animations in your README.md file, you can use this syntax to embed images or gifs hosted on the web:

```markdown
![SmartScreen Settings](https://path/to/your/screenshot_or_gif.gif)
```

- Upload the gif to a hosting platform (like **Giphy**, **Imgur**, or your GitHub repository) and use the URL in the markdown to display it.
- You can also host the gifs directly in your repository under a `/assets` folder and link to them like this:

```markdown
![SmartScreen Settings](./assets/smartscreen-settings.gif)
```

---

With this structure, you can easily explain how to bypass or disable SmartScreen while adding helpful gifs for clarity.
